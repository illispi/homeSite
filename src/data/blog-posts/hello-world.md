Hello, I prefer to stay mostly anonymous, so you won't find any bio in this blog introduction.

I've been programming for a while now, and my one and only deployed personal project, [stories.delvis.org](https://stories.delvis.org/), is mostly finished. However, I have to upgrade to solid start v1 when itâ€™s launched and add OAuth logins for some social media services. I think the Node server also crashes because solid start doesnâ€™t serialize trpc errors quite right, so I need to figure out what I am going to do with that. I have a branch with Elyssia conversion, so I might complete that to get rid of that error. Some polish is still needed as well.

I started programming in fall 2018, by following "Automate the Boring Things with Python." It was a great introduction to programming, and after that, I tried to make my own game engine with C, learning from ChiliTomatoNoodle and Cherno, but nothing worthwhile ever materialized from that. I struggled with C, especially with things like memory management, since it usually involved ad hoc malloc() and free(), if I remembered. Also, shader math was quite difficult for me, especially with matrices and stuff. I mean, I kind of grasped some of it, but trying to make something with graphics like a rasterizer was hard.

So later, I started trying web development. I completed most of the [FullStackOpen.com](https://fullstackopen.com/en/) course. I learned a lot from it, and for the first time, I felt like I could do something on my own. So I made "Stories" with SolidJS and its Solid Start framework. I had done quite a bit with Next.js and React, but I converted away from that just for the fun of it. It wasnâ€™t particularly difficult since SolidJS and React are quite similar at a glance, but they do some things differently, like component rendering. This is a good article on that: [React to solidjs article](https://www.stashpad.com/blog/react-developer-guide-to-solid-js). I will probably do a full post-mortem on my project later.

Currently, I am trying to make a game, but we will see if that ever pans out into a finished product. Game development seems a bit more difficult compared to web development projects I have done so far, but I guess that makes it a bit more fun and engaging in a way.

P.S. Changing from Node.js to BunJS sped up the GitHub Actions runtime from almost 5 minutes to 3 minutes.
